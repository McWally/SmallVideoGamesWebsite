## Intro
Objective: develop a `Mobile First` website as a small video games store/database (ONLY HTML - CSS).

**More pages:** _Video Games List_ - _News List_ - _Ranking (optional)_ - _Survey (optional)_ - _Contact_

## The Beginning
This was my first website created from zero, **only using** `HTML` and `CSS`

I was learning `CSS` while doing the website.\
